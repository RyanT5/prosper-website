**Why Central Africa’s Conflict Minerals Matter for Prosper Social Finance**

**Introduction**

As a student-led ESG investment fund, Prosper Social Finance must scrutinize the ethical risks within its portfolio equities' supply chains. While Prosper primarily invests in developed markets, many of its holdings—particularly in technology, semiconductors, and clean energy—are indirectly reliant on critical minerals sourced from high-risk regions, particularly the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Cobalt, coltan (processed tantalum), tin, and tungsten are essential for electric vehicles, semiconductors, and renewable energy infrastructure. The DRC has been fraught with conflict for over 30 years, with more than 200 rebel groups vying for dominance over mineral-rich territories (1). Once in control, militia groups impose forced labor, child exploitation, and violent extortion on workers (4).

Efforts to regulate final good supply chains, such as the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act and the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation, have broadly failed to stop mineral revenue from funding militia operations. Large quantities of illicit minerals still enter global markets via false certifications, smuggling, and opaque refining processes.

For Prosper, this issue is directly relevant—many of its portfolio companies rely on these materials, exposing them to ethical, regulatory, and reputational risks. This report examines how conflict minerals continue to infiltrate supply chains, the paradox in certification schemes, and the steps ESG investors must take to drive meaningful change.
