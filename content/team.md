<h3 class="team-member-name">Vicky Grant</h3>
<h5 class="team-member-position">Executive Director</h5>
<p>"I am a 4th year Economics and Politics student. Growing up in Greece, I developed mixed feelings about finance but coming to university I knew it was a discipline I wanted to explore. Prosper was the ideal way to do this. It not only challenged my perception of finance, it also taught me how to use technical skills to deliver positive social impact. I am excited to lead Prosper in this new chapter and help expand its reach to students and social enterprises.”</p>
