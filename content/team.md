<p>“I am a fourth year Economics and Mathematics student. I have first-hand experienced the mixture of economic development and instability in emerging markets which led me to wonder if finance can be used to achieve long-term sustainable growth. Being a part of Prosper since my first year at the university, I am proud to witness and contribute to the growth of the fund, as well as our expanding impact on the local communities. I look forward to widening Prosper’s engagement with students and social enterprises, and continuing to deliver positive social change through our responsible, student-led investments.”</p>

<p>“My name is Albert Doyle and I am in my second year at Edinburgh University, studying an MA in Geography. I am really pleased to be the Head of Investment Tracking at Prosper, having joined as a Junior Analyst last semester and gaining a lot of technical ability. Coming from a non-Finance degree background it was really encouraging to see that this did not disadvantage me in any way. I hope to encourage other students from a diverse range of degrees to join and improve upon the transparency of the work we do at Prosper Social Finance, hopefully using some of my data analytics skills!”</p>

<h5 class="team-member-position">Head of Strategy</h5>
<p>“I am a fourth year Philosophy and Politics student from Washington, DC. I joined Prosper in my second year because I found the world of finance pretty intimidating. I was drawn to Prosper’s accessible, compassionate, and sustainable approach to teaching financial essentials and to its commitment to positive social impact. Over the last two years, Prosper has challenged my perception of finance and taught me how it can be utilised as a force for good. As Head of Social Impact, I am excited to expand Prosper’s reach to students and social enterprises in Edinburgh by strengthening community engagement.”</p>
