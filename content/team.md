<p>"Having been a part of Prosper for my entire university career, I've gained invaluable technical and soft skills as  well as met industry leaders from diverse fields.

<p>“Hi everyone! My name is Paula Quevedo, and I’m currently in my fourth year studying Mathematics and Statistics. I completed the ATP during the second semester of my first year and joined the Management Team in my second year as Head of Marketing. After spending a year abroad, I’m excited to return to Edinburgh and step into the role of Head of Investment Strategy at Prosper. Prosper has played a key role in shaping both my university experience and professional development. It’s allowed me to connect with incredible people and develop a wide range of skills—from analytical thinking to leadership and communication. I’m thrilled to see how Prosper continues to grow in the year ahead as we push forward in our mission to drive meaningful social change.”</p>

<h5 class="team-member-position">Head of Social Impact</h5>
<p>“Prosper has been a foundational experience in the evolution of my personal and professional skills.  The ATP has been extremely helpful in evidencing my technical skills, as well as softer skills, such as those formed when I interviewed the Head of Investor Relations of a FTSE 100 company for my team’s report.  Most importantly, there is a wonderful sense of community and driving purpose that centres everybody around the change that we can make through the ethos of impact investing.”</p>

I joined as a Junior Analyst last year, got stuck into ESG analysis, pitched ASML, and quickly realised this was the place to be. Now I’m leading strategy and partnerships — working with societies like 180DC and FreshSight, supporting our analyst team, and helping grow Prosper’s presence across campus.What I love most about Prosper is how it brings purpose into finance — and I’m excited to keep building that with the team this year.”</p>
