<p>"I am currently in my fourth and final year reading Economic History. I joined Prosper in my second year and it has truly been the best aspect of my university experience.

I am really pleased to be the Head of Investment Tracking at Prosper, having joined as a Junior Analyst last year. Coming from a non-Finance degree background it was really encouraging to see that this did not disadvantage me in any way.
