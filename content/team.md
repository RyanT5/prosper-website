<h3 class="team-member-name">Vicky Grant</h3>
<h5 class="team-member-position">Executive Director</h5>
<p>"I am a 4th year Economics and Politics student. Growing up in Greece, I developed mixed feelings about finance but coming to university I knew it was a discipline I wanted to explore. Prosper was the ideal way to do this. It not only challenged my perception of finance, it also taught me how to use technical skills to deliver positive social impact. I am excited to lead Prosper in this new chapter and help expand its reach to students and social enterprises.”</p>

<h5 class="team-member-position">Head of Training</h5>
<p>“I am third year Business and Economics student. Initially, I got involved with Prosper seeing it as a fun and novel way to learn about sustainable investing, but now I see it as so much more than that. I can't wait to spice up the training program and pass on the values Prosper has instilled in me, all whilst raising our analyst’s financial literacy and increasing their awareness of sustainability."</p>
