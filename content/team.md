<p>"Hi all! I’m Ethan the new Executive Director of Prosper and a 4th Year studying Economic History. Prosper has been a major part of my university journey, starting out as a junior and senior analyst in my first year. Since then, I’ve been lucky enough to watch Prosper grow, as we challenge the traditional perceptions of the finance industry through both student autonomy and a strong socially responsible philosophy. As Executive Director, I can’t wait to work with new analysts looking to join Prosper and the Management Team! Please reach out to me or the Team if you have any queestions about Prosper or the application process.”</p>

<p>“Hi! I’m Matt and I am studying towards a Master in Chemical Engineering. I am really pleased to be the Head of Training at Prosper, having joined as a Junior Analyst last semester and gaining a lot of financial acumen. Coming from a non-finance degree background, it was really encouraging to see that this did not disadvantage me in any way and enabled me to complete an internship in Venture Capital. I hope to encourage more STEM students to join! The organisation has been a massive help in breaking into finance and extremely rewarding with the ESG initiatives.”</p>

<p>I’m Alec, Head of Investment this year. I joined Prosper in January this year and have enjoyed every minute so far. Prosper has been a superb opportunity to meet incredible new people and develop employable skills beyond the scope of my course. As a Geography and Economics student, Prosper’s ethos and approach captures the best of both worlds for me, and with the breadth of our work and opportunities, Prosper will always offer something for everyone. You just have to be brave enough to get involved."</p>
