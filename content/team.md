<p>"My name is Grace Gubbay and I am a third year Chemistry student.  Over the last year, the ATP and SAP programme’s have allowed me to contribute to a unique community of assiduous individuals, challenging my perceptions of finance and highlighting to me the importance and responsibility of prioritising a more sustainable future.

As Director of Social Impact, I am excited at the opportunity of extending and shaping Prosper’s relationship with both students and the Edinburgh community as we reach our 5-year investment horizon.”</p>
