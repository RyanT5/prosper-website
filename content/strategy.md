Our investment strategy is directly derived from our philosophy and, as in all that we do, it is governed by our core values.

We are a value fund; investing in relatively stable companies with a history of profitability and a feasible growth story. Inherently we aim to be a low-risk fund and employ a mix of statistical and ESG/value-based protocols when executing our investments in order to achieve this. Importantly, we do not attempt to time the market. Rather, we believe that value-based businesses, such that we invest in, are intrinsically more likely to succeed. This is our source of growth.
