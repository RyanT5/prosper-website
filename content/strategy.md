Our investment strategy is directly derived from our philosophy and, as in all that we do, it is governed by our core values.

We are a value fund; investing in relatively stable companies with a history of profitability and a feasible growth story. Inherently we aim to be a low-risk fund and employ a mix of statistical and ESG/value-based protocols when executing our investments in order to achieve this. Importantly, we do not attempt to time the market. Rather, we believe that value-based businesses, such that we invest in, are intrinsically more likely to succeed. This is our source of growth.

More specifically, at Prosper any potential investment must pass a 5-stage analysis. The first and most important stage is an assessment of core-value alignment with those of Prosper. This is where we determine what drives a business. Secondly is an ESG screening, where we apply a unique ESG matrix to all sectors of a business. In this stage we determine whether a business places real importance on ESG factors throughout their business and does not simply engage with surface level corporate social responsibility. On passing both of these analyses, a potential investment is then subjected to a financial assessment, followed by an industry/business analysis and then a wider macroeconomic analysis.
