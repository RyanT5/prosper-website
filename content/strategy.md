Our investment strategy is directly derived from our philosophy and, as in all that we do, it is governed by our core values.

We are a value fund; investing in relatively stable companies with a history of profitability and a feasible growth story.

Importantly, we do not attempt to time the market. Rather, we believe that value-based businesses, such that we invest in, are intrinsically more likely to succeed. This is our source of growth.

To identify such businesses we employ a 5 stage investment analysis:
