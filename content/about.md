Prosper Social Finance is the UKâ€™s first socially responsible investment fund run entirely by students at the University of Edinburgh. Our mission is to deliver positive social change in Edinburgh through responsible, student-led investments. We aim to challenge traditional perceptions of finance, making the world of investment more compassionate and responsible.

To do so, we run an equity portfolio underpinned by our five core values and our environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria; it is these underpinnings which ensure our investments have an indirect positive social and environmental impact. We believe this strategy reduces our risk and helps us identify companies which will outperform the market in the long run.

As a social enterprise, we do not invest for profit but to make a positive social impact. All profits from our investments will be used to make our own direct social impact investments into local charities, projects and social enterprises. Through these efforts we also aim to get our members more involved and aware of the local community they are a part of.

At the core of what we do are our Programmes. It is through these programmes that students at Edinburgh University can join us in our mission, learn more about socially responsible investments, and receive top quality training on the fundamentals of finance. We also aim to connect our members with the global and local community of socially responsible investing.

In this spirit, we have formed a strong community of like-minded individuals who are interested in finance and want to make a difference.
