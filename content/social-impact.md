As a social enterprise, our primary goal at Prosper is not financial gain but rather to create a positive social impact. The profits from our portfolio are channelled back into the local Edinburgh community through grants. These profits are directed to local socially-beneficial projects, carefully selected by our senior analysts. 

In Semester 1 of 2022/23, our Senior Analyst Programme cohort led our Social Impact Grant Selection aiming to establish a long-term, sustainable, and mutually beneficial relationship with local enterprises via The Good Stuff Network. We derived social impact metrics to track our investment success and assess how these opportunities align with our core values and the Sustainable Development Goals.
