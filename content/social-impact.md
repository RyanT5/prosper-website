As a social enterprise, we do not invest for profit but to make a positive social impact. The profit that we make in excess of the amount invested - after adjusting for inflation - will be taken out of our portfolio after 5 years and redirected to the local Edinburgh community in the form of grants. We aim to contribute to community projects that will maximise our social impact. With the first round of investments maturing in December, we are excited for Prosper to reach the potential the founders hoped for back in 2018!
