Our Senior Analyst Programme is available to Prosper’s Analysts who have undergone the Analyst Training Programme. The Senior Analyst Programme is designed to expand Analyst’s knowledge of Prosper’s investments and its processes as a fund and social enterprise. Rather than working through a syllabus, Senior Analysts work on projects which may relate to all areas of Prosper’s operations. Senior Analysts work closely with the Management Team, with greater independence and have the opportunity to make their own impact on Prosper’s activities.

In the beginning of each semester, before applications for the Programme open, the Management Team announces 2-3 projects which the Senior Analysts will complete during the semester. Throughout the semester they are guided by the Management Team but complete the majority of their work independently and submit the final product at the end of the semester.

Since new projects are announced each semester, Senior Analysts can be part of the Senior Analyst Programme for as many semesters as they wish. The Programme is also designed to allow Senior Analysts to be part of the programme in non-consecutive semesters.

        Throughout the semester you will need to work on your project and attend frequent group meetings to update the rest of the team on your work progress. But overall the Senior Analyst Programme allows for much greater flexibility, as you will complete the majority of your work independently and submit the final product at the end of the semester.

        Our Senior Analyst Programme is available only to Prosper’s analysts who have undergone the Analyst Training Programme. This is because we want to ensure that our senior analysts have a rigorous understanding of our fund, its philosophy and strategy. Whilst you may have some experience with finance, the Analyst Training Programme may be ideal for you! Sustainable finance is different from other areas of finance and you may find it an enriching experience although you have previous experience.
