### I - Introduction

We value the trust that you place in us by sharing your personal data with us. Prosper Social Finance ("Prosper”, “we”, or “us”) takes your privacy seriously and is committed to handling your personal data in a way that is fair and worthy of that trust. This privacy policy describes how we collect and use information pertaining to each of our unregistered visitors and registered users (each, a “visitor” or “user” (respectively), or “you”), in connection with their access to and use of Prosper’s website. Therefore, we encourage you to read this privacy policy carefully.

### II - What information do we collect?

We collect two types of information regarding our visitors and users:

Un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a visitor or un-identified user, which may be made available to us, or collected automatically via his/her use of our website (“non-personal information”). Such non-personal information does not enable us to identify the visitor or user from whom it was collected. The non-personal information collected by us mainly consists of technical and aggregated usage information, which includes (but is not limited to) visitors’ and users’ browsing and ‘click-stream’ activity on our website, non-identifying information regarding the visitor’s or user’s device, operating system, internet browser, screen resolution, language and keyboard settings, internet service provider, exit pages, and time stamps.

Individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable efforts cause the identification of an individual or may be of private or sensitive nature (“personal information”). The personal information collected by us mainly consists of contact details (e.g., e-mail address or phone number), correspondences (including those made through or uploaded to our website), and any other personal information provided to us by visitors and/or users through their access to and/or use of our website. For the avoidance of doubt, any non-personal information that is connected or linked to personal information is deemed and treated by us as personal information, as long as such connection or linkage exists.​

### III - How do we collect it?

There are two main methods that we use:

We collect information through your use of our website. When you browse our website, we are aware of it and will usually collect and record such uses, sessions, and other related information, usually with the help of third-party services as detailed in Section VI below, including through the use of “cookies” as further detailed in Section VII below.

We collect information which you provide us voluntarily. For example, we collect the personal information you provide us when you sign up for our mailing list or members’ page; and/or when you contact us directly by any communication channel (e.g., live chat, e-mail).

### IV - Why do we collect such information?

We collect such non-personal and personal information for the following purposes:

To provide and operate our website;

To further develop, customize, and improve our website, based on visitors’ and users’ common or personal preferences, experiences and difficulties;

To provide our users with ongoing assistance and support;

To be able to contact our visitors and users with general or personalized Prosper-related notices and messages;

To create aggregated statistical data and other aggregated and/or inferred non-personal Information, which we may use to provide and improve our respective services;

To comply with any applicable laws and regulations.

### V - Sharing personal information with third parties

Prosper may share your personal information with third parties (or otherwise allow them access to it) only in the following manners and instances:

Third-party services: Prosper has partnered with a number of selected service providers, whose services and solutions complement, facilitate, and enhance our own. These include hosting and server co-location services, web analytics, e-mail distribution and monitoring services, session recording and remote access services, performance measurement, data optimization and marketing services, and APIs (collectively, “third-party service(s)”). Such third-party services may receive or otherwise have access to our visitors’ and/or users’ personal information, in its entirety or in part – depending on each of their particular roles and purposes in facilitating and enhancing our website and may only use it for such purposes. Note that while our website may contain links to other websites or services, we are not responsible for such websites’ or services’ privacy practices. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our website and read the privacy statements of each and every website and service you visit before providing your personal information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such linked third -party websites and services.

Law Enforcement, Legal Requests and Duties: where permitted by local data protection laws, Prosper may disclose or otherwise allow others access to your personal information pursuant to a legal request, such as a subpoena, legal proceedings, search warrant or court order, or in compliance with applicable laws, if we have good faith belief that the law requires us to do so, with or without notice to you.​

### VI - Use of cookies and other tracking technologies

Prosper uses certain monitoring and tracking technologies (such as cookies, pixels, and scripts). These technologies allow us to maintain and improve our website on an ongoing basis, providing you with a better experience.

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive by your web browser when you visit any website. They allow information gathered on one web page to be stored until it is needed for use on another, allowing a website to provide you with a personalised experience and the website owner with statistics about how you use the website so that it can be improved.

Some cookies may last for a defined period of time, such as one day or until you close your browser. Others last indefinitely. Your web browser should allow you to delete any you choose. It also should allow you to prevent or limit their use. Please note that deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies or tracking technologies may prevent you from accessing certain areas or features of our website or may otherwise adversely affect your user experience.

Please also note that third-party services placing cookies or utilising other tracking technologies through our website may have their own policies regarding how they collect and store information. Such practices are not covered by our Privacy Policy and we do not have any control over them.

### VII - Communications from Prosper Social Finance

We may use your personal information to send you marketing content and messages by e-mail, and similar forms of communication from Prosper through such means. If you do not wish to receive such promotional messages, you may notify us at any time or follow the “unsubscribe” instructions contained in the contents you receive.

## VIII - Updates and interpretation

We may update this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law, and to reflect changes to our information collection, usage, and storage practices. If we make any changes that we deem as “material” (in our sole good faith discretion), we will notify you prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

Unless stated otherwise, our most current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you, with respect to our website.
