Our social impact is largely a result of our engagement with the Edinburgh student body and wider community. Firstly, our 8-week Analyst Training Programme is our most direct means of delivering a positive impact within the university. Since our inception, Prosper has trained over 200 students from the University of Edinburgh, ranging from first-years to Masterâ€™s students, studying a wide range of degrees.

When marketing Prosper, we reach out to all corners of the University, in order to attract a diverse range of students. By doing so, we have made finance more accessible and understandable to people who may have been sceptical or intimated to learn more about it.

### This Year's Change: Social Impact Grants

As Prosper is reaching the end ot our first 5-year investment horizon, this year will be the first time we give out Social Impact Grants. Funded by the returns on our investments, these grants will be a way to directly impact the local community. We are currently working hard to ensure that these grants are delivered as effectively as possible. 

### Events

Events are one of the ways we seek to connect students, investors and social enterprises. With a strong track record in delivering thought-provoking lectures, networking opportunities and community socials, we are looking forward to hosting more vents in the coming year.
